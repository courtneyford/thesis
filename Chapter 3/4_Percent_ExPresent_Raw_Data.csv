Because this is a nonstandard way of writing the number 1, it probably didn't have enough data to know that 1 could be written that way and therefore went with the closest thing it could find, which was a 2. Including additional data that included the number 1 being written in that way would probably improve it, although I'm not sure the problem would ever go away 100%.",""
